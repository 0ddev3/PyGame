This project served as a foundational exercise to test our skills in designing a user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) using Python. As beginners, our goal was to apply what we've learned by creating a simple yet engaging story-based game.

In this interactive game, players navigate through a branching narrative by making choices at various points. Upon launching the game, users are presented with an option to start or exit through "Yes" and "No" buttons. If they choose to play, they proceed to a character selection screen, where they can pick between two characters: Tom or Jill.

Once the character is chosen, the story unfolds, and players are presented with different scenarios and choices. Each decision shapes the progression, making the experience dynamic and personalized. The game continues until the player reaches the conclusion, at which point a "Thank You for Playing" message appears along with an exit button.

This project allowed us to experiment with basic Python concepts, user input handling, and UI design principles, laying the groundwork for more complex future projects.
